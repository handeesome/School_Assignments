This asssignment did not finish on time, therefore only the first couple functions are implemented.
Thus, the two files are both not ready to be compiled and not being able to run.
I just realized the deadline is 22:00 instead of 23:59pm.
Up to this point of time, everything is ready except receiving and sending messages between clients and the server and then validate the answers.

Sorry for incomplete codes and i totally understand if i dont get any point for this. :)
If only, if only i can have one extra hour haha.
