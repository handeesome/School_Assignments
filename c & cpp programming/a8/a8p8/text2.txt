The story is set in medieval Germany. Hansel and Gretel are the children of a poor woodcutter.
When a famine settles over the land, the woodcutter's wife (stepmother to Hansel and Gretel)
decides to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves so she
and her husband will not starve to death. The woodcutter opposes the plan but finally reluctantly
submits to his wife's scheme, unaware that Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the
parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many white pebbles as he
can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them.
